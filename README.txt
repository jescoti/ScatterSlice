ScatterSlice is a program that enables rapid implementation of cell-to-cell variability analysis (CCVA). CCVA is a methodology to identify the proteins or markers that determine cellular responses to stimulus. The methodology has been used in three publications as a complement to computational modeling.

ScatterSlice is written in R, using the window manager package TKRplot, which adds Tcl/Tk functionality to R.
